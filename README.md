# RGLCG
Relating Global and Local Connectome Changes to Dementia and Targeted Gene Expressions in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

This repo comprises the code for the manuscript Elsheikh et al. XXX XXX 

This work uses data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative publicly available

The image data are processed accoding to the pipeline reported in the script pre_process.sh Tractography, connectome creation and feature extraction is given in the scripts compute_conn_CSA.py, tracking_conn_ACT.py, metrics.py and metrics.py. Those scripts are inside the folder Script.

The main bioinformatics analyis is in the scipt analysis.py

# Download the Data
The data extracted from MRI volumes  needed in this analysis are accessable in the [Data folder](https://github.com/elssam/RGLCG/tree/master/Data)
Those are the resulting connectomes, and the features
