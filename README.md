This work uses data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative publicly available

The image data are processed accoding to the pipeline reported in the script pre_process.sh Tractography, connectome creation and feature extraction is given in the scripts compute_conn_CSA.py, tracking_conn_ACT.py, metrics.py and metrics.py. Those scripts are inside the folder Scripts.

The main bioinformatics analyis is in the scipt analysis.py

# Download the Data
The data extracted from MRI volumes  needed in this analysis are accessable in the [Data folder](https://github.com/elssam/RGLCG/tree/master/Data)
Those are the resulting connectomes, and the features.
While the neuroimaging scripts are inside  [this folder](https://github.com/elssam/RGLCG/tree/master/Scripts)
